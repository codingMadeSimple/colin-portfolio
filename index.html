        <h4>üèîÔ∏èFrom Summit Seeker to Code Creator: Crafting Digital Peaks:</h4>
        Hi, I'm Colin Spangelo, a passionate skier, hiker and rock climber, who's swapping the mountains for the
        digital world. With a heart set on adventure and a mind tuned to precision, I'm now scaling the peaks of web
        development.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>üéø Slopes to Scripts:</h4>
        My journey began amidst snowy slopes and vertical cliffs, where I learned the value of perseverance,
        problem-solving, and attention to detail. Now, I'm harnessing those same skills to craft seamless digital
        experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>üíª Crafting Code, Crafting Connections:</h4>
        As a web developer, I specialize in JavaScript, React JS, [mention your primary skills/technologies]. From
        responsive layouts to dynamic functionalities, I thrive on turning ideas into interactive realities. Whether
        it's building a user-friendly interface or optimizing performance, I love breaking down a problem into it's
        smallest parts and start solving the puzzle piece by piece.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>üîß Tools of the Trade:</h4>
        Proficient in [list programming languages, frameworks, and tools], I'm adept at navigating the ever-evolving
        landscape of web development. From HTML to JavaScript, from React to Node.js, I'm constantly expanding my
        toolkit to deliver cutting-edge solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>üöÄ Beyond the Summit:</h4>
        When I'm not immersed in the world of code, you'll find me exploring new trails, seeking fresh powder, or
        scaling up rock faces. My love for adventure fuels my creativity, driving me to push boundaries and reach new
        heights‚Äîboth on and off the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
        <h4>ü§ù Let's Connect:</h4>

        simply want to swap stories over a virtual cup of coffee, I'd love to connect. Reach out <a>EMAIL PLACEHOLDER OR

          <p>Charcoal & Cabernet is a web application built for restaurants that allows users to reserve specific
            seating while booking a reservation. A user can register an account and log in/out. A logged in user can
            store their favorite dishes between sessions, create orders and view previous orders. After a user places a
            delivery order they will receive delivery status update texts. If a user would like to dine in they can
            input a date and time they would like as well as their party size. The user can then select the seat they
            would like on a map of the restaurant which will show available seats in blue and already booked seats in
            red. </p>
